- Implement early intervention for patients showing "unverändert" (unchanged) status
- Use status improvements as positive reinforcement indicators

### 3. Predictive Model Implementation
**Model 2 provides**: A practical 3-factor prediction model for NBE compliance.

**Risk Stratification**:
- **High Risk**: High pain scores + unchanged/worsened status
- **Moderate Risk**: Moderate pain scores + mixed status progression  
- **Low Risk**: Low pain scores + improved status

### 4. Resource Allocation Optimization
**Model 2 enables**: Evidence-based resource planning based on three predictors.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Allocate additional support resources based on the 3-factor model
- Focus interventions on pain management and healing progression monitoring

## Conclusions

The exclusion of Risk Factor from the logistic regression analysis was **highly beneficial and statistically justified**:

1. **Substantial sample size improvement** (503 → 1,075 patients, +113.7%)
2. **Discovery of two clinically important predictors** previously hidden by insufficient power
3. **More precise effect estimates** with narrower confidence intervals
4. **Better representativeness** with reduced selection bias
5. **Enhanced clinical utility** with actionable 3-factor prediction model

**Primary Finding**: Pain scores, pain status improvements, and function status improvements are the key predictors of NBE compliance, providing clear targets for clinical intervention.

**Clinical Impact**: The larger, more representative sample provides robust evidence for implementing targeted pain management and healing progress monitoring protocols to improve NBE compliance rates.

**Statistical Conclusion**: Model 2 (without Risk Factor) should be used as the primary analysis, with Risk Factor exclusion being both statistically justified and clinically beneficial.
