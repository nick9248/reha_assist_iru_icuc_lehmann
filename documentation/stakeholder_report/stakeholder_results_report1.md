## Detailed Results

### 1. Total Cases Advised

**Research Question:** *How many cases were advised in total?*

**Finding:** **1,523 unique patients** received consultation services.

**Key Points:**
- Analysis based on unique patient identifiers to avoid double-counting multiple visits
- **100% data completeness** - no patients excluded due to missing identifiers
- High-quality dataset with excellent data integrity

### 2. Gender Distribution Analysis

**Research Question:** *How many women and men were advised in total?*

**Findings:**
- **Female patients:** 819 (53.9%)
- **Male patients:** 701 (46.1%)
- **Data completeness:** 99.8% (only 3 patients with missing gender information)

**Statistical Analysis:**
- **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test** performed to test deviation from equal distribution (50:50)
- **Test Result:** χ² = 9.16, p = 0.0025
- **Interpretation:** The gender distribution is **statistically significantly different** from a 50:50 split
- **Clinical Significance:** Female patients are moderately but significantly more likely to seek consultation services

*Figure 1: Gender Distribution of Advised Patients - Professional pie chart demonstrates clear visual representation of gender proportions. Female predominance is evident but not extreme.*

### 3. Average Age Analysis

**Research Question:** *What is the average age of the respondents overall?*

**Primary Finding:** **50.09 years** (Standard Deviation: 17.25 years)

**Detailed Age Statistics:**
- **Median age:** 53 years
- **Age range:** 3 to 94 years
- **Valid data:** 1,394 patients (91.5% completeness)
- **Missing data:** 129 patients (8.5%) excluded due to missing age information

**Distribution Characteristics:**
- **Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test:** W = 0.983, p < 0.001
- **Result:** Age distribution is **not normally distributed**
- **Pattern:** Left-skewed distribution with concentration in middle-age to older adult ranges
- **Clinical Interpretation:** The patient population skews toward middle-aged and older adults

**Age Distribution Patterns:**

*Figure 2: Age Distribution Analysis - Left panel shows histogram of observed age distribution with theoretical normal distribution overlay (red line). Right panel shows box plot revealing median, quartiles, and outliers. The distribution clearly deviates from normal, showing left-skewed pattern with concentration in middle-age ranges.*

**Key Visual Insights:**
- **Peak frequency:** 50-60 years age group clearly visible in histogram
- **Distribution shape:** Left-skewed with longer tail toward younger ages
- **Box plot reveals:** Median around 53 years with some younger outliers
- **Normal comparison:** Red overlay line shows how actual distribution differs from theoretical normal distribution

## Data Quality Assessment

### Exclusions and Missing Data

| **Category** | **Excluded Cases** | **Percentage** | **Reason** |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Patient IDs | 0 | 0.0% | All patients had valid identifiers |
| Gender Data | 3 | 0.2% | Missing or invalid gender information |
| Age Data | 129 | 8.5% | Missing age at accident date |
| Age Outliers | 0 | 0.0% | All ages within reasonable range (0-120 years) |

**Overall Data Quality:** Excellent (>91% completeness for all variables)

## Clinical and Operational Insights

### Patient Demographics Profile
1. **Mature Patient Population:** Average age of 50 years indicates services primarily serve middle-aged to older adults
2. **Female Utilization:** Significantly higher female utilization (53.9%) suggests either:
   - Higher accident/injury rates among women in the catchment area
   - Greater healthcare-seeking behavior among female patients
   - Possible referral pattern differences by gender

### Age Distribution Implications
1. **Non-Normal Distribution (Visual Evidence):** The histogram clearly shows left-skewed distribution with:
   - **Peak concentration:** 50-60 years (highest bars in histogram)
   - **Asymmetric pattern:** Longer tail toward younger ages
   - **Box plot confirmation:** Median (red line) around 53 years with outliers visible
   - **Normal deviation:** Red overlay line demonstrates significant departure from normal distribution

2. **Service Planning Considerations:**
   - Programs should be optimized for middle-aged to older adult needs
   - Age-appropriate communication and intervention strategies recommended
   - Consider age-specific outcome measures and treatment protocols
   - Visual evidence supports focus on 40-70 year age range (main concentration area)

### Population Health Insights
1. **Gender Patterns:** The female predominance may reflect:
   - Epidemiological patterns of accidents/injuries in the region
   - Healthcare access and utilization patterns
   - Referral system characteristics

2. **Age Patterns:** The age distribution suggests:
   - Services are reaching their intended adult population
   - Potential need for pediatric-specific pathways (given lower representation of very young patients)
   - Strong representation of working-age adults who may benefit from return-to-work interventions

## Statistical Methods Summary

### Tests Performed
1. **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test** (Gender Distribution)
   - Null Hypothesis: Equal gender distribution (50:50)
   - Result: Rejected (p = 0.0025)
   - Conclusion: Significant female predominance

2. **Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test** (Age Distribution)
   - Null Hypothesis: Age data follows normal distribution
   - Result: Rejected (p < 0.001)
   - Conclusion: Non-normal, left-skewed distribution

### Data Processing
- **Patient-Level Analysis:** Used first consultation record per patient to avoid multiple-counting
- **Outlier Detection:** Applied reasonable age limits (0-120 years)
- **Missing Data Handling:** Transparent exclusion with detailed logging

---

## Conclusions

1. **Substantial Patient Volume:** 1,523 unique patients represents a significant consultation caseload
2. **Gender Distribution:** Statistically significant female predominance (53.9% vs 46.1%)
3. **Age Profile:** Middle-aged population (mean 50 years) with non-normal, left-skewed distribution
4. **Data Quality:** Excellent overall completeness (>91% for all key variables)

### Recommendations
1. **Service Design:** Optimize for middle-aged to older adult demographics
2. **Gender Considerations:** Investigate factors driving female predominance
3. **Age-Specific Protocols:** Develop age-appropriate intervention strategies
4. **Data Collection:** Maintain excellent data quality standards observed in this analysis
