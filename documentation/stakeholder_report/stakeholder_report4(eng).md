## Research Questions and Methodology

### Primary Research Questions:
1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Is there a correlation between healing process group and number of phone calls?
   - Is there a correlation between healing process group and duration of phone calls?

2. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Do ICUC scores (P/FL/StatusP/StatusFL) influence NBE assessment?
   - How do age, gender, and risk factors change the prediction?

### Statistical Methods Applied:
- **Spearman Rank Correlation** (non-parametric, suitable for ordinal data)
- **Logistic Regression** with odds ratios and confidence intervals
- **Model diagnostics** including VIF analysis and outlier detection

#### Why These Methods Were Chosen:

**Spearman Rank Correlation:**
- **Definition:** A non-parametric statistical measure that assesses the strength and direction of association between two ranked variables
- **Why suitable for our data:** Our healing groups are ordinal (ordered categories: 1→2→3 representing increasing complexity), and contact/duration data may not follow normal distributions
- **Advantage over Pearson:** Does not assume linear relationships or normal distribution, making it robust for medical data with potential outliers
- **Interpretation:** Values range from -1 to +1, where 0.2-0.4 indicates weak to moderate correlation (clinically meaningful in healthcare research)

**Logistic Regression:**
- **Definition:** A statistical method used to predict binary outcomes (NBE Yes/No) using multiple predictor variables
- **Why suitable:** Our dependent variable (NBE compliance) is binary, and we have multiple predictors of different types (continuous, ordinal, categorical)
- **Model equation:** log(odds) = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₖXₖ
- **Output interpretation:** Provides odds ratios showing how much each factor increases or decreases the likelihood of NBE compliance

**Odds Ratios (OR):**
- **Definition:** The ratio of odds of an event occurring in one group versus another
- **Clinical interpretation:** 
  - OR = 1: No effect
  - OR > 1: Increased odds (e.g., OR = 2 means 2x higher odds)
  - OR < 1: Decreased odds (e.g., OR = 0.5 means 50% lower odds)
- **Example from our study:** Pain score OR = 0.574 means each 1-point increase in pain reduces NBE compliance odds by 42.6%

**VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) Analysis:**
- **Definition:** Measures how much the variance of a regression coefficient increases due to correlation with other predictors
- **Purpose:** Detects multicollinearity (when predictors are highly correlated with each other)
- **Interpretation:** VIF > 5 indicates potential multicollinearity problems
- **Our results:** All predictors showed VIF < 5, confirming each variable contributes unique information

**AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):**
- **Definition:** A measure of model quality that balances goodness of fit with model complexity
- **Purpose:** Helps compare different models; lower AIC indicates better model
- **Formula:** AIC = 2k - 2ln(L), where k = number of parameters, L = likelihood
- **Clinical relevance:** Ensures we're not overfitting the model with too many variables

### Missing Data Analysis - Detailed Explanation:

**Complete Case Analysis Definition:**
- **Complete cases:** Patients with valid (non-missing) data for ALL variables included in the logistic regression model
- **Rationale:** Statistical models require complete data for all predictors to generate reliable estimates
- **Alternative approaches:** Multiple imputation or maximum likelihood methods (not used due to complexity and potential bias introduction)

**Step-by-Step Data Reduction Process:**
1. **Starting Point:** 1,229 patients with valid NBE outcome data
2. **After Pain Score (P):** 1,197 patients remaining (32 excluded - 2.6% loss)
3. **After Function Score:** 1,196 patients remaining (33 excluded - 2.7% loss)
4. **After Age:** 1,088 patients remaining (141 excluded - 11.5% loss)
5. **After Risk Factor:** 506 patients remaining (723 excluded - 58.8% loss)
6. **After Status Variables:** 503 patients remaining (726 excluded - 59.1% total loss)

**Primary Causes of Data Loss:**

**Risk Factor Variable - Major Impact:**
- **Missing rate:** 668 out of 1,229 patients (54.4%)
- **Clinical reason:** Risk factor assessment may not be consistently documented across all patient encounters
- **Impact on analysis:** This single variable caused the largest data reduction in our study
- **Consideration:** Future studies might consider making risk factor documentation mandatory or using imputation methods

**Age Variable - Moderate Impact:**
- **Missing rate:** 111 patients (9.0%)
- **Clinical reason:** Age at accident might not be consistently recorded in all patient files
- **Pattern:** Random missing pattern, likely due to administrative data entry issues

**Status Variables (StatusP/StatusFL) - Minor Impact:**
- **Missing rate:** ~3.5% each
- **Clinical reason:** These are core clinical assessments, so missing rates are low
- **Quality indicator:** Low missing rates suggest good clinical documentation practices

**Pain and Function Scores - Minimal Impact:**
- **Missing rate:** <3% each
- **Clinical reason:** These are routine clinical measurements with standardized protocols
- **Quality indicator:** Excellent data completeness for core clinical measures

**Impact Assessment of Missing Data:**

**Representativeness Analysis:**
- **Retained sample:** 503 patients (40.9% of original sample with NBE data)
- **Risk of bias:** Patients with complete risk factor data might represent a specific subgroup
- **Generalizability:** Results should be interpreted with caution due to substantial missing data

**Sensitivity Considerations:**
- **Conservative approach:** Complete case analysis provides unbiased estimates if data is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
- **Potential bias:** If missingness is related to patient characteristics (Missing at Random - MAR), results may not be fully representative
- **Clinical validity:** Despite missing data, the sample size (503) remains adequate for reliable statistical inference

**Recommendations for Future Studies:**
1. **Improve data collection protocols** for risk factor documentation
2. **Consider multiple imputation methods** for handling missing data
3. **Implement mandatory data fields** for critical clinical variables
4. **Conduct missing data pattern analysis** to identify systematic issues

## Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis provides strong statistical evidence for several clinically important relationships:

1. **Healing complexity significantly correlates with resource utilization**, supporting the need for differentiated care planning based on healing trajectory.

2. **Pain scores emerge as the most reliable predictor of NBE compliance**, suggesting that pain management should be prioritized to improve treatment outcomes.

3. **The predictable nature of these relationships** enables healthcare organizations to implement evidence-based resource allocation and early intervention strategies.

4. **Clinical decision-making should incorporate pain assessment** as a primary factor in determining patient support needs and NBE compliance risk.

The findings support implementing targeted interventions focused on pain management and differentiated care protocols based on healing trajectory complexity. These evidence-based strategies have the potential to improve both patient outcomes and healthcare resource efficiency.
